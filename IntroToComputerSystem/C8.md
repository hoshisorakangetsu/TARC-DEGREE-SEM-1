# Chapter 8

## Old memory management issues
- Program need to be **loaded entirely** into the memory
- **Fragmentation** can occur
  - Internal frag.
  - External frag.
- Cause **overhead** due to relocation (need adjust their places)

# Virtual Memory
> a.k.a Virtual Storage
- A **special memory area** that some OS support which uses the secondary storage device (hdd, ssd etc)
- A memory management technique to allow programs execute even they are not loaded into the memory (RAM) entirely.
- Loaded **on-demand**
- My own words
  - Take out several place of your permanent storage call it swap, that can be used to store some currently running program, in case ur RAM not enough space, when that program is needed, will swap in
- Pros
  - Job size not restricted to RAM size
  - Allow unlimited amount of multiprogramming
  - + **Paging**
    - No external fragmentation
    - Small amount of internal fragmentation
  - + **Segmentation**
    - No internal fragmentation
- Cons
  - Hardware cost UP
  - Overhead UP (handle paging interrupts)
  - Software complexity UP (prevent thrashing)

# Memory Management Schemes
- [Paged Memory Allocation]
- [Demand Paging Memory Allocation]
- [Segmented Memory Allocation]
- [Segmented / Demand Paged Memory Allocation]

## Paged Memory Allocation
> aka Paging
- Divides each page into same size of chunks (**Page**)
- Partition the memory into small equal-size chunks (**Frame**)
- **Pages** loaded into **Frames**
- Best condition
  - Page size == Frame size == Disk sector size
  - Sizes depends on operating system and disk sector size
- Before program execution, memory management need to:
  - Determine number of pages in program
  - Locate enough empty page frame in memory
  - Loads **ALL** program pages into the empty page frames
