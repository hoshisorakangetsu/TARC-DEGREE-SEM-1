## Hardware element
#### **Physical mechanism** to:
- Execute instructions
- Storing & moving data
- Electronically control and manipulate:
    - IPO (Input-Process-Output) / IPC (Information Processing Cycle)

#### Consists of
- [Keyboard and peripheral devices](#peripheral-devices)
- [CPU](#cpu)
- [RAM](#ram)
- Storage Devices
    - Computer memory
        - Any device that is capable of storing things (temporary or permanently)
    - Volatile memory
        - Store data **temporary**
        - Need constant power to hold information
        - Primary storage
        - [RAM](#ram)
    - Non-volatile memory
        - Store data **permanently**
        - Do not require constant power to hold information
        - Secondary storage
        - ROM

#### RAM
- Random Access Memory
- Made up of large number of memory cells
    - Often grouped in array of cells
    - All cells have their own memory address
- One cell can store 8bit (1 byte) of data
- Amount of storage can determine how many instructions are loaded at one time

#### CPU
- Central Processing Unit
- Calculation and Computations
- Consists of
    - [Control Unit (CU)](#control-unit-cu)
    - [Arithmetic Logic Unit](#arithmetic-logic-unit-alu)
    - [Interface Unit](#interface-unit-iu)
    - [Registers](#register)

#### Control Unit (CU)
- Directs and coordinates most of the operations
- Every instruction triggers the following steps for the CPU (a machine cycle)
    - Fetching
        - Issued by CU
    - Decoding
        - Issued by CU
    - Executing
        - Done by ALU
    - Storing
        - Issued by CU

#### Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Performs
    - Arithmetic operations `+ - * /`
    - Comparison operations `< <= > >= ==`
    - Logical operations `&& || !`

#### Interface Unit (IU)
- Connects CPU and memory or I/O modules
- Moves program instructions

#### Register
- Fast memory for storing frequently accessed data to accelerate machine cycle

#### Peripheral Devices
- Input device
    - Controls data insertion (input from user)
- Output device
    - Controls data conveyance (give user feedback)
- Data **bus**
    - Move data/instruction between components

## Software Element
- Instruction to tell the computer system
    - What to perform
    - How to perform
- Categories
    - [System software](#system-software)
    - [Application software](#application-software)

#### System software
- Interface between user and computer
- Main categories
    - [OS](#operating-system-os)
    - [Utility programs](#utility-program)

#### Operating System (OS)
- Essential part of computer system
- Coordinate activities aong computer hardware resources
- Run application software
- Software platform
- Eg: Macintosh, Windows, Linux/Unix

#### Utility program
- Perform tasks related to manage computer and its resources
- Maintain and enhance system performance
- Eg: Disk defragmenter, scandisk, uninstaller

#### Application Software
- Runs on top of an operating system
- Written and designed for users to get work done
- Eg: games, MS Word, web browsers

## Data Elements
- Raw materials
- Not processed
- Not useful to users
- Data vs Information
    - Data -> Processing -> Information

## Communication Element
- Support communication between interconnected components ([Computer Networks](#computer-networks))
- Required communication components
    - Channel
        - Establish connection
        - Fibre-optic cables
    - I/O hardware
        - An interface between computer and communication channel
        - Modem
    - Network Protocols
        - Defines the set of rule for communication
        - TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

#### Computer Networks
- A collection of *computers and devices connected together* via **communication devices** and **transmission media**
- Network is essential to facilitate physical connection for:
    - Data communication
    - Hardware sharing
    - Software sharing
    - Funds transfer
- Successful communication requires
    - [Sending device](#sending-device)
    - [Communication device](#communication-device)
    - [Transmission media](#transmission-media)
    - [Receiving device](#receiving-device)

#### Sending Device
- Initiates instruction to start transfer of data

#### Communication Device
- Connects sending/receiving device to transmission media

#### Transmission Media
- The medium which the data travels in

#### Receiving Device
- Accepts the transmission of data

#### Type of networks
- LAN (Local Area Network)
    - Connects computer and devices in a limited area
    - Home, office etc
- MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
    - Connects several LAN together
    - City or town
- WAN (Wide Area Network)
    - Covers a large geographical area
    - Country, World

#### Network Architecture
- Communication framework for computers, devices, and media on a network
- [Client-server architecture](#client-server-architecture)
- [Peer to peer architecture](#peer-to-peer-architecture)

#### Client-server architecture
- Client send **request** to server
- Server send **response** to client
- Resource sharing is centralized in a server
- A server usually is a powerful machine owned by an organization

#### Peer to peer architecture
- Everyone can be client/server
- If you are **sharing** content, you are the *server*
- If you are **requesting** content, you are the *client*
- Resource sharing is decentralized
